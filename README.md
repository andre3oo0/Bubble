Bubble is an AI-powered emotional support assistant designed to provide a comforting, safe
space for users to express themselves, manage overthinking, and find emotional relief. Inspired
by the concept of a “bubble” as a protective, secure environment, the assistant aims to help
individuals navigate moments of emotional distress, offering personalized support through
calming interactions, soothing music, and wellness prompts.
The primary goal of Bubble is to create an emotionally supportive environment where users can
feel safe and cared for. It is tailored to assist users in managing overthinking, anxiety, and
moments of emotional overwhelm by offering calming affirmations, soothing gestures, and
encouraging self-care practices. Over time, Bubble learns user preferences, adapting its
responses to provide the most effective emotional support.
